# Space-debris-tracking-and-movement-prediction-to-prevent-collisions-with-active-satellites

Today's man-made space-debris environment is a direct consequence of the relentless pace of space activities that have taken place since Sputnik's pioneering launch in 1957. 
Since that pivotal moment, the orbital landscape has become increasingly crowded, marked by more than 4000 rocket launches and a disturbing array of other debris-generating occurrences,
including over 150 in-orbit fragmentation events.


This unchecked proliferation has led to a critical situation: among the more than 8700 objects currently larger than 10 cm in Earth orbits, a staggering reality emerges â€“ only about 6% are operational satellites, while the vast remainder is inert space debris. 
This problem is further exacerbated by the burgeoning number of new satellite mega-constellations and ever-increasing launch rates, projecting a future with an even more densely populated orbital environment.

The implications of this congestion are severe. Even small pieces of debris, traveling at orbital velocities of tens of thousands of kilometers per hour, possess immense kinetic energy. 
A collision could lead to catastrophic consequences: the destruction of invaluable operational satellites, disruption of vital services that humanity relies on daily (such as communication, navigation, and weather forecasting)
and the generation of even more debris, triggering a cascading chain reaction known as the Kessler Syndrome. This self-sustaining cycle of collisions could render certain orbital regions unusable for decades, posing an existential threat to future space exploration and utilization.

In light of this escalating risk, the development of robust and proactive solutions for space situational awareness is no longer a luxury, but an imperative. Effectively tracking this burgeoning population of orbital junk and accurately predicting potential collision events are paramount to safeguarding our active space assets and ensuring the long-term sustainability of space. 
It is against this critical backdrop that this project aims to contribute, developing a system focused on the precise tracking and prediction of space debris movement to prevent such catastrophic encounters with operational satellites.


This project, "Space debris tracking and movement prediction to prevent collisions with active satellites" is structured around three core phases to tackle this challenge:

Phase 1: Data Acquisition, Cleaning, and Transformation.

Phase 2: Orbital Tracking and Visualization.

Phase 3: Quantitative Conjunction Analysis and Collision Prediction.
